This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

## Run Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Order of Nice-to-Have features

- Progress Bar Indicator
- Filters for Users
- Sorting
- Pagination
- Drag and Drop Feature

I have chosen this order according to the priority of elements that can improve the user experience. Like Progress Bar is on the first position in the priority list because it indicates the user how much it needs to wait for the application processing. Filtering the users in the user-list and sorting them helps the user to find its desired selection. Pagination gives freedom to the user to explore as many photos as it wants. Drag and Drop are last in the list because its a feature which is supposed to be mostly used by touch-screen users (limited targetted audience).

## Improvement in the current application for better UX.

- **Slideable Sidebar Userlist**: Allows the users to focus on the main content (album & photos)
- **Responsive layout**: Allows users to use the application on smaller screens (tabs and mobiles etc).
- **Toast msg display**: Tells the users about the states of the application in a descriptive way.
